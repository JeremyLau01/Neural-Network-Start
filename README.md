# Neural-Network-Start
I began creating a neural network from scratch using python.
I am trying to classify/group three different colored points on a graph in a spiral pattern.
Each significant version/change is labled 'n# (description)'

I finished implementing the ReLU activation function (n7). Next, I look to implement backpropagation.

I followed sentdex's playlist on youtube:youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3
